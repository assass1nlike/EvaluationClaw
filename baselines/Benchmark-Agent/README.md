## 🌟 Introduction

**Benchmark Everything Everywhere All at Once** introduces **Benchmark-Agent**, a fully autonomous agentic system for benchmark construction and customization.

Given a high-level evaluation goal in natural language, **Benchmark-Agent** orchestrates the complete pipeline: requirement analysis, subtask design, data grounding, transformation planning, sample realization, and quality control, with no manual dataset curation required.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shiyun-x/Benchmark-Agent.git
cd Benchmark-Agent

uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

---

### 🔑 Configuration

All API and model settings are configured in **`utils/resources/models.yaml`**:

```yaml
# API credentials
api:
  api_key: "your_api_key"
  base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"

# Per-agent model selection
agents:
  design: "gpt-5.4"
  grounding: "gpt-5.4"
  allocation: "gpt-4o"
  # ...

# Per-tool model selection
# ...
```

Each agent and tool uses its own model. You can mix and match providers or model tiers to balance cost and quality.

---

### 📂 Prepare Inputs

Benchmark Agent needs **(1) a user query** and **(2) dataset cards**.

> [!NOTE]
> We provide ready-to-run example user queries in [`user_queries/`](user_queries/) (covering text, audio, and image modalities) and a set of dataset cards in `data/dataset_cards/`. You can run the pipeline on these directly without any additional setup.

#### 1. User query (`user_queries/user_query_XX.json`)

```json
{
  "id": "user_query_01",
  "description": "Your evaluation intent in natural language.",
  "target_size": 200
}
```

| Field | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `id` | Unique identifier for this benchmark instance |
| `description` | Your evaluation intent (natural language) |
| `target_size` | Total number of benchmark items to generate |

#### 2. Dataset card config (`utils/resources/dataset_cards.yaml`)

`utils/resources/dataset_cards.yaml` lists the dataset IDs to load and points to the card directory. See **[`data/data.md`](data/data.md)** for dataset download, format, directory layout, and instructions for adding custom datasets.

#### 3. Tool config (`utils/resources/tools.yaml`)

Benchmark Agent integrates both LLM-based and pure transformation tools. `utils/resources/tools.yaml` registers the available tools. See **[`tools/executor_tools/tools.md`](tools/executor_tools/tools.md)** for the full inventory, usage, and how to add a new tool.

<table>
<tr>
<th align="center">🤖 LLM Tools</th>
<th align="center">🛠️ Non-LLM Tools</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

- Context construction
- Question rewriting
- Dialogue synthesis
- Reasoning transformation

</td>
<td>

- Text-to-Speech (XTTS v2)
- Speech-to-Text
- OCR
- Image degradation
- Audio noise mixing

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Non-LLM tools are referred to as *pure tools* in the codebase.

#### 4. Cache path (`--cache_path`)

Stores **intermediate artifacts** for **reproducibility** and **faster reruns**.
- **Debugging & manual edits**: keep a **stable** `--cache_path` across runs; edit cached **subtasks**, **dataset assignments**, or other agent outputs, then resume without rerunning earlier stages
- **New start**: point to a **new folder** to rerun from scratch

---

### 🚀 Run

```bash
python generate_benchmark.py \
  --topic_id              user_queries/user_query_01 \
  --dataset_card_config   utils/resources/dataset_cards.yaml \
  --cache_path            cache/ \
  --model_config_path     utils/resources/models.yaml
```

All intermediate results are cached under `cache/{user_query_id}/`. You can edit agent caches (e.g. subtask definitions, grounding results) between runs. The pipeline will resume from the modified state without recomputing earlier stages.

**Outputs** written to `cache/{user_query_id}/`:

| File | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `evaluation.json` | Final verified benchmark samples |
| `evaluation_with_audio_settings.json` | Same as above, with audio generation parameters (audio user queries only) |

> [!NOTE]
> For audio user queries, post-pipeline speech synthesis is required. See **[`tools/executor_tools/tools.md`](tools/executor_tools/tools.md)** for instructions.

## ✨ How Benchmark-Agent Works

### 1️⃣ Design & Grounding

**📝 Design Agent**

- Decomposes the user query into a set of subtasks, each capturing one atomic capability
- Assigns modality constraints (text / image / audio / mixed), answer type, and output schema per subtask
- Iterates via **propose → revise → discard** cycles until the subtask set stabilizes

**🔬 Grounding Agent**

- Constructs dataset retrieval preferences from the subtask set
- Searches, scores, and filters candidate datasets for each subtask
- Assesses whether a concrete (dataset, transformation) execution plan is feasible
- Rejects subtasks that cannot be grounded and feeds back to the Design Agent for revision; loops until all subtasks are grounded or the retry budget is exhausted

---

### 2️⃣ Allocation

**💭 Allocation Agent**

Distributes sample quotas across (dataset, subtask) pairs, balancing global target size, per-dataset capacity, subtask coverage, and diversity. If allocation falls short, the system loops back to grounding with feedback before retrying.

---

### 3️⃣ Realization & Execution

**📚 Sample Planning**

- Expands allocation results into (dataset, subtask, index) triples
- Assigns a step-by-step transformation plan to each triple

**⚙️ Execution Engine**

- Runs LLM-based steps (context construction, question rewriting, dialogue synthesis, reasoning transformation) in parallel across samples
- Executes non-LLM tools (TTS, OCR, image degradation, web search, audio noise mixing) as pure backends with outputs cached to disk
- Retries failed steps with fallback strategies before marking as failures

**🔍 Verification Layer**

- **Schema validation**: all required input/output fields are present and correctly typed
- **Answer-type checking**: answer format matches the subtask spec; options are unique and non-trivial
- **Semantic alignment**: the sample is answerable, faithful to the source, and does not leak the answer
- **Quota checking**: per-subtask verified counts are compared against allocation targets; gaps trigger a replenishment round
