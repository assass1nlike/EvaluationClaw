You are assisting a benchmark construction system.

Given a subtask, your job is to describe what kinds of dataset characteristics would make a dataset POTENTIALLY useful for building evaluation QA samples for that subtask.

Here, a subtask is a specific evaluation objective within the benchmark: it defines the capability or behavior to test, the intended input/output schema, and the answer type. It is NOT necessarily the same as a dataset's native task.
A useful dataset may provide raw material, annotations, context, or structure that can be transformed into QA samples for this objective.

====================
SUBTASK CONTEXT
====================
- subtask_id: {sid}
- name: {name}
- description: {desc}
- keywords: {keywords}


Sample schema (the structure of input/output for this subtask):
{sample_schema_str}

Answer type:
{answer_type}

Based on this subtask, propose dataset PREFERENCES (not hard constraints) following the instructions.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
- This is NOT a strict requirement list.
- Do NOT try to perfectly match the final benchmark task.
- Your job is to describe dataset potentials and affordances.
- Favor HIGH RECALL: include anything that could yield useful data after transformation.
- Do NOT filter out datasets just because their native QA format does not match.

You should reason about two types of usefulness:

Type A (native usefulness):
  Datasets whose existing QA samples are directly helpful with light transformation.

Type B (meta usefulness):
  Datasets whose meta structure (e.g., narrative context, dialog, bbox, segmentation,
  multi-turn conversation, options, etc.) could provide high-quality raw material
  for creating new QA, even if the native QA is not suitable.

You must express your preferences in terms of:
- domains (high-level topics)
- field roles (from a closed set)
- modality
- structural affordances
- semantic affordances

CLOSED SET OF FIELD ROLES
You MUST choose roles ONLY from this closed set (keys in "preferred_roles"):

{canonical_roles}

where:
- "context": main input content the model reads (passage, story, article, prompt, document, etc.)
- "question": query/instruction that asks about the context
- "answer": target label or text answer
- "rationale": explanation / reasoning text for the answer
- "dialog": multi-turn conversation (sequence of utterances, often with speaker roles)
- "options": multiple-choice options
- "image": image reference (path/id/url)
- "audio": audio reference (path/id/url)
- "category": category labels or tags
- "bbox": bounding boxes for visual objects
- "mask": segmentation masks for visual regions
- "point": point annotations for visual content
- "entity": structured entities or spans with types
- "span": explicit span indices or extracted spans used for answers/annotations
- "table": tabular data or structured tables

====================
ROLE PREFERENCES:
- You DO NOT need to include all roles.
- Include a role only if having that role in a dataset could be helpful.
- Each role can have:
  - a natural language "reason"
  - style and content_extent preferences (as soft preferences)
  - style means the general tone/format of the content, different modalities may have different styles(e.g., text style: narrative, factual, dialog, instruction; image style: scenery, objects, diagram, etc; audio style: speech, music, environmental, etc.)
  - content_extent means the length/size/complexity of the content (e.g., text length: short, medium, long, mixed; image size: small, medium, large; audio duration: short, medium, long, mixed)
  - an optional "semantics_hint"
  - a "weight" in [0, 1] (how important this role is; 0.0-0.3 = minor, 0.4-0.7 = useful, 0.8-1.0 = very important)
- We have tools to transform between some roles semantically (e.g., "rationale" <-> "answer", "context" <-> "dialog"..), and some modality conversions (e.g., "text" -> "audio" via tts).
- So DO NOT be overly restrictive in role selection.

DOMAINS:
- "preferred_domains" is a list of free-text domain tags that would be especially useful.
- These are soft preferences, NOT hard filters.

RULES:
- Do NOT specify MUST/ONLY/REQUIRED conditions.
- Roles MUST come only from the closed set.
- All fields are soft preferences.
- Do NOT output commentary outside JSON.


====================
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON)
====================
You MUST output a SINGLE JSON object of the form:

{{
  "preferred_roles": {{
    "<role>": {{
      "reason": "<why this role helps for this subtask>",
      "style_preferences": ["narrative", "factual", "dialog", "instruction", "other", etc.],
      "content_extent_preferences": ["short", "medium", "long", "mixed"],
      "semantics_hint": "<optional natural-language hint (1-2 sentences)>",
      "weight": 0.0
    }}
  }},

  "preferred_domains": ["<domain>", "..."]

}}
